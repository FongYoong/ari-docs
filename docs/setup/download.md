!!! info "Tip"

    === "Windows"
        * The first time you start Ari, Windows Defender may scan the file for a few seconds before running it.
        * Chrome or Microsoft Edge may warn about the file because it is "uncommonly downloaded".
        Before jumping to conclusions, you can always scan the file with [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).
    
    === "Linux"
        * Execute `chmod +x ari-linux` if permission error is encountered.

## **Building from source**

* This section is for those want to experiment with Ari's source code.

!!! tip "General steps"
    1. Clone Ari's [repository](https://github.com/FongYoong/ari-lang) üë™

    2. Install the Rust toolchains (Rustc, Rustup, Cargo).
        * [Follow instructions here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
    3. Install nightly Rust with:
        * ```rustup toolchain install nightly```
    4. Move into the cloned repository
        * ```cd ari-lang```
    5. Configure the project to use nightly Rust:
